# org.kde.plasma.wavetask
It still has many bugs, but it more or less works. It's based on the default task manager of KDE 6.5.

How to install:
- First install the panel layout, which you can download from: https://github.com/vickoc911/org.kde.desktop.PanelZoom
- Download the code
- Unzip and rename the folder to org.kde.plasma.wavetask
- Copy the org.kde.plasma.wavetask folder to /home/yourusername/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/
- Add the panel with wavetask
- That's it.

Features:

- Zoom like in macOS
- Icon mirroring
- Basic skin system
- Option to select the icon size
- option to select the zoom size

What doesn't work:
- For now, it only works in the bottom position
- The panel has been resized to 76 pixels so that icons aren't cut off when zooming
- And much more...
