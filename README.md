It still has many bugs, but it more or less works. It's based on the default task manager of KDE 6.5.

Features:

- Zoom like in macOS
- Icon mirroring
- Basic skin system

What doesn't work:
- For now, it only works in the bottom position
- Currently, icons are fixed at 44 pixels
- The panel has been resized to 76 pixels so that icons aren't cut off when zooming
- And much more...
